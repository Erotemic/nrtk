v0.7.0
======

Added support for JitterOTFPerturber Plugfigurability rehydration and dehydration.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

* Removed perturber interface restriction which required that input image dimensions be maintained.
  Note perturbers which modify image dimensions (including rotations) should be used with caution as
  scoring can be impacted if groundtruth isn't similarly transformed.

* Updated git lfs to properly track large files in any directory

* Added functionality to dehydrate and rehydrate JitterOTFPerturber objects with config files
